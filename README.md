### 2. Create a New Branch
Always create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
```
Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the task or feature, e.g., `feature/login-page` or `bugfix/fix-login-error`.

git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
```

Before pushing your branch, ensure it's up to date with the latest changes from the main branch:
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-branch-name
git merge main
```
Resolve any merge conflicts, if necessary.

### 6. Push Your Changes
Push your branch to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)
1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab and click the **New Pull Request** button.
3. Select your branch as the source branch and `main` as the target branch.
4. Add a clear and concise title and description for your PR, explaining what youâ€™ve changed and why.
